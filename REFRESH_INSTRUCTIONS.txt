HOW TO PROPERLY REFRESH THE PROJECT
========================================

Your project is running on http://127.0.0.1:5500 (Live Server)

STEP 1: HARD REFRESH THE BROWSER
---------------------------------
Press one of these key combinations to clear cache:

Windows/Linux:
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + R  OR  Ctrl + F5
- Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + R  OR  Ctrl + F5

Mac:
- Chrome/Edge: Cmd + Shift + R
- Firefox: Cmd + Shift + R

STEP 2: VERIFY FILES LOADED
----------------------------
1. Open Browser Console (F12)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. You should see:
   === FEATURE_EXTRACTION.JS LOADED - VERSION 2.0 ===
   === APP.JS LOADED - VERSION 2.0 ===
   Onion Shelf Life Prediction System loaded

If you DON'T see these messages:
- Close the browser completely
- Reopen and go to http://127.0.0.1:5500
- Hard refresh again

STEP 3: TEST THE FEATURES
--------------------------
1. Upload an onion image OR start webcam
2. Check console for:
   === REAL EXTRACTED FEATURES ===
   {black_spots_count: X, surface_texture_score: Y, ...}

3. Watch the "Extracted Features" section update with real values

STEP 4: IF STILL NOT WORKING
-----------------------------
1. Stop Live Server (click "Port: 5500" in VS Code status bar)
2. Clear browser cache completely:
   - Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data > Cached images
3. Restart Live Server
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5500 in new incognito/private window

WHAT SHOULD WORK NOW:
---------------------
✓ Features extract from REAL webcam image
✓ Black spots count changes with different objects
✓ Surface texture varies based on edges
✓ Skin condition reflects brightness
✓ Damage indicators toggle dynamically
✓ Sprouting detects green colors
✓ Everything updates every 1 second in webcam

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If features show "undefined":
- Check console for errors
- Verify feature_extraction.js loaded (see version log)
- Make sure featureExtractor is initialized

If features don't change:
- Verify you see "REAL EXTRACTED FEATURES" in console
- Check that webcam is actually running
- Try uploading different images to test
